## Technical part

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- App uses Pages directory
- For design, Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI were utilized
- To get user for authentication react context and backend endpoint was used
- Higher Order Components were made use of for Protected Routes
- Deployed via Docker on AWS EC2

  

## Getting Started

  

First, run the development server:

  

```bash

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm dev

```

  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

  

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

  

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

  

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

  

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
